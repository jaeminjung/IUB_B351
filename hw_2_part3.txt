speed of uninformed and informed search methods

the speed of performance is not really different, however
the probability of reaching to goal for informed-search is way higher than uniformed search
so that informed-search reached to goal-state

there are too much of domain for 8-puzzle about 180000. 
So, basically i programmed like
	first we got initial state as argument, and check it, if it is goal or not
and then, we put visited array.
next, we generate all possible states that we can move next, and append them to frontier array.
when append to frontier, we check these possible states are in visited array or not.
if it is in visited, we do not put it into frontier.
and we pop a element in frontier and check it, if it is goal or not.
and generate all possible states that we can move to next
.... and so on, until find the goal state


initial state was = [[8,7,6],[5,4,3],[3,2," "]]
and the goal state was = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7," ",8]]
wiith uninformed search, it exceed the limit of 5000 times, however, with same initial state,
informed search found in less than 900 times


the maximum difficulty of problems was to come out the idea of well heuristics method.
Since there so much of possible states, what heuristics method that I made doesn't feel like
working well to solving 8-puzzle. 
So I just gave big points if all first row matched with goal state.
also, I calculated number of tiles that different with goal state.
